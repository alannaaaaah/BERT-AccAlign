here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	28-28 14-14 10-10 27-27 11-11 12-12 22-22 21-21 1-1 18-18 2-2 13-13 30-30 4-4 26-26 3-3 17-17 19-19 9-9 25-25 29-29 20-20 5-5 24-24 31-31 0-0 15-15 8-8 16-16 23-23 6-6 7-7	28-28 14-14 10-10 27-27 11-11 12-12 22-22 21-21 1-1 18-18 2-2 13-13 30-30 4-4 26-26 3-3 17-17 19-19 9-9 25-25 29-29 20-20 5-5 24-24 31-31 0-0 15-15 8-8 16-16 23-23 6-6 7-7
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	29-33 9-13 15-19 67-72 32-36 34-38 38-42 12-16 36-40 39-43 72-77 7-11 26-30 1-1 18-22 49-54 60-65 2-2 23-27 52-57 11-15 31-35 42-47 69-74 58-63 4-4 51-56 94-79 3-3 45-50 10-14 21-25 28-32 65-70 71-76 24-28 47-52 70-75 96-81 17-21 30-34 46-51 48-53 37-41 56-61 8-12 13-17 64-69 68-73 33-37 43-48 44-49 61-66 5-5 54-59 14-18 66-71 93-78 59-64 95-80 40-44 50-55 19-23 63-68 57-62 0-0 35-39 22-26 16-20 41-45 53-58 20-24 62-67 25-29 55-60 27-31	74-79 83-32 86-8 9-13 49-77 87-9 67-72 32-36 34-38 38-42 12-16 36-40 39-43 7-11 26-30 1-1 18-22 60-65 2-2 23-27 52-57 11-15 42-47 69-74 58-63 4-4 84-33 75-80 51-56 82-31 3-3 45-50 10-14 21-25 65-70 71-76 81-6 85-7 70-75 17-21 30-34 46-51 48-53 37-41 56-61 8-12 64-69 68-73 96-81 33-37 43-48 44-49 61-66 5-5 54-59 66-71 59-64 40-44 50-55 19-23 63-68 57-62 73-78 88-10 0-0 35-39 22-26 16-20 41-45 53-58 20-24 62-67 25-29 55-60
