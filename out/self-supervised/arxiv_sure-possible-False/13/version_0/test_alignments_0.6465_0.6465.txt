here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	21-21 29-29 28-28 24-24 6-6 11-11 10-10 1-1 2-2 3-3 16-16 17-17 23-23 26-26 25-25 4-4 27-27 20-20 22-22 12-12 18-18 19-19 30-30 0-0 31-31 5-5 13-13 15-15 8-8 7-7 9-9 14-14	21-21 29-29 28-28 24-24 6-6 11-11 10-10 1-1 2-2 3-3 16-16 17-17 23-23 26-26 25-25 4-4 27-27 20-20 22-22 12-12 18-18 19-19 30-30 0-0 31-31 5-5 13-13 15-15 8-8 7-7 9-9 14-14
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	94-79 13-17 69-74 46-51 28-32 38-42 45-50 9-13 24-28 32-36 61-66 53-58 63-68 23-27 30-34 18-22 37-41 41-45 26-30 64-69 47-52 11-15 8-12 43-48 29-33 10-14 49-54 67-72 22-26 96-81 58-63 19-23 1-1 25-29 33-37 70-75 2-2 3-3 12-16 17-21 57-62 56-61 51-56 52-57 39-43 93-78 55-60 15-19 4-4 48-53 72-77 21-25 35-39 36-40 20-24 34-38 44-49 54-59 40-44 95-80 65-70 0-0 14-18 5-5 50-55 27-31 62-67 31-35 59-64 66-71 68-73 60-65 71-76 7-11 16-20 42-47	69-74 46-51 38-42 45-50 9-13 32-36 61-66 63-68 53-58 64-69 23-27 30-34 18-22 37-41 41-45 26-30 82-31 11-15 31-19 8-12 43-48 29-33 10-14 49-54 67-72 22-26 86-8 58-63 96-81 83-32 19-23 1-1 25-29 33-37 70-75 2-2 3-3 85-7 81-6 12-16 17-21 57-62 56-61 51-56 52-57 39-43 55-60 4-4 48-53 73-78 21-25 35-39 36-40 20-24 34-38 44-49 54-59 88-10 40-44 95-80 65-70 0-0 87-9 5-5 74-79 50-55 62-67 66-71 59-64 68-73 60-65 71-76 7-11 16-20 42-47
