here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	1-1 22-22 10-10 28-28 24-24 21-21 2-2 17-17 6-6 20-20 18-18 30-30 25-25 29-29 8-8 23-23 14-14 26-26 15-15 5-5 31-31 19-19 4-4 7-7 13-13 3-3 27-27 9-9 11-11 0-0 16-16 12-12	1-1 22-22 10-10 28-28 24-24 21-21 2-2 17-17 6-6 20-20 18-18 30-30 25-25 29-29 8-8 23-23 14-14 26-26 15-15 5-5 31-31 19-19 4-4 7-7 13-13 3-3 27-27 9-9 11-11 0-0 16-16 12-12
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	1-1 30-34 56-61 28-32 8-12 19-23 16-20 24-28 34-38 2-2 33-37 49-54 52-57 53-58 54-59 60-65 65-70 15-19 96-81 25-29 61-66 10-14 11-15 69-74 66-71 67-72 72-77 14-18 58-63 51-56 40-44 42-47 64-69 50-55 22-26 43-48 5-5 44-49 68-73 63-68 93-78 13-17 27-31 21-25 32-36 20-24 4-4 18-22 29-33 31-35 45-50 41-45 55-60 3-3 12-16 23-27 35-39 38-42 46-51 71-76 62-67 70-75 95-80 9-13 7-11 26-30 36-40 39-43 59-64 94-79 48-53 0-0 57-62 47-52 17-21 37-41	1-1 30-34 56-61 75-80 8-12 19-23 16-20 34-38 53-58 2-2 52-57 54-59 65-70 74-79 60-65 6-7 96-81 25-29 61-66 10-14 11-15 69-74 87-9 66-71 67-72 58-63 51-56 40-44 42-47 64-69 50-55 22-26 43-48 5-5 44-49 49-77 63-68 68-73 73-78 88-10 81-6 21-25 32-36 20-24 4-4 18-22 29-33 45-50 41-45 55-60 3-3 86-8 83-32 12-16 35-39 38-42 46-51 71-76 62-67 70-75 9-13 7-11 26-30 36-40 39-43 59-64 82-31 48-53 0-0 57-62 17-21 37-41
