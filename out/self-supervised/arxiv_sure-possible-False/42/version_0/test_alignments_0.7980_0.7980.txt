in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	17-21 29-33 19-23 25-29 12-12 7-7 10-10 16-16 24-28 4-4 23-27 13-13 22-26 8-8 0-0 9-9 26-30 20-24 1-1 6-6 3-3 11-11 31-35 5-5 2-2 15-15 21-25 30-34 28-32 18-22 14-14 27-31	17-21 29-33 19-23 25-29 12-12 7-7 10-10 16-16 24-28 4-4 23-27 13-13 22-26 8-8 0-0 9-9 26-30 20-24 1-1 6-6 3-3 11-11 31-35 5-5 2-2 15-15 21-25 30-34 28-32 18-22 14-14 27-31
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	26-26 29-29 28-28 12-12 7-7 17-17 10-10 16-16 14-14 20-20 4-4 31-31 13-13 8-8 0-0 9-9 27-27 24-24 1-1 6-6 3-3 11-11 5-5 2-2 15-15 21-21 23-23 25-25 22-22 30-30 19-19 18-18	26-26 29-29 28-28 12-12 7-7 17-17 10-10 16-16 14-14 20-20 4-4 31-31 13-13 8-8 0-0 9-9 27-27 24-24 1-1 6-6 3-3 11-11 5-5 2-2 15-15 21-21 23-23 25-25 22-22 30-30 19-19 18-18
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	17-21 29-33 8-12 39-43 19-23 25-29 54-59 55-60 38-42 57-62 93-78 56-61 45-50 40-44 15-19 43-48 24-28 47-52 65-70 42-47 69-74 4-4 34-38 23-27 37-41 41-45 59-64 53-58 36-40 32-36 33-37 22-26 60-65 70-75 0-0 16-20 71-76 72-77 11-15 52-57 95-80 20-24 1-1 49-54 68-73 64-69 50-55 3-3 10-14 13-17 31-35 44-49 5-5 2-2 21-25 62-67 51-56 66-71 9-13 30-34 58-63 94-79 28-32 67-72 35-39 61-66 46-51 48-53 96-81 14-18 7-11 18-22 26-30 12-16 27-31 63-68	17-21 29-33 8-12 39-43 19-23 25-29 54-59 55-60 38-42 73-78 57-62 87-9 56-61 45-50 40-44 86-8 43-48 65-70 42-47 69-74 4-4 34-38 37-41 41-45 59-64 75-80 53-58 36-40 32-36 60-65 22-26 70-75 71-76 0-0 16-20 83-32 11-15 52-57 20-24 1-1 68-73 82-31 64-69 6-7 50-55 3-3 10-14 44-49 5-5 2-2 21-25 62-67 51-56 66-71 74-79 9-13 30-34 58-63 88-10 67-72 35-39 61-66 46-51 81-6 96-81 49-77 7-11 18-22 26-30 12-16 48-53 63-68
