here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	19-19 23-23 9-9 13-13 25-25 4-4 12-12 15-15 17-17 5-5 18-18 6-6 26-26 21-21 0-0 29-29 22-22 30-30 28-28 27-27 16-16 10-10 24-24 31-31 14-14 3-3 2-2 7-7 11-11 8-8 1-1 20-20	19-19 23-23 9-9 13-13 25-25 4-4 12-12 15-15 17-17 5-5 18-18 6-6 26-26 21-21 0-0 29-29 22-22 30-30 28-28 27-27 16-16 10-10 24-24 31-31 14-14 3-3 2-2 7-7 11-11 8-8 1-1 20-20
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	18-22 32-36 7-11 27-31 49-54 56-61 96-81 71-76 55-60 4-4 41-45 53-58 38-42 19-23 31-35 5-5 68-73 59-64 67-72 70-75 17-21 44-49 72-77 36-40 50-55 11-15 8-12 64-69 21-25 51-56 60-65 14-18 10-14 42-47 20-24 0-0 24-28 94-79 25-29 43-48 9-13 26-30 48-53 12-16 40-44 65-70 54-59 23-27 47-52 30-34 34-38 63-68 57-62 28-32 95-80 35-39 58-63 13-17 69-74 15-19 37-41 52-57 3-3 16-20 39-43 45-50 46-51 22-26 61-66 2-2 66-71 93-78 33-37 29-33 62-67 1-1	18-22 32-36 7-11 56-61 96-81 71-76 55-60 4-4 41-45 53-58 73-78 38-42 19-23 5-5 68-73 59-64 67-72 70-75 17-21 44-49 72-77 36-40 50-55 82-31 11-15 8-12 64-69 74-79 21-25 51-56 60-65 10-14 42-47 20-24 0-0 81-6 86-8 25-29 43-48 9-13 87-9 26-30 31-19 48-53 12-16 40-44 65-70 83-32 54-59 23-27 63-68 57-62 35-39 58-63 69-74 37-41 52-57 3-3 16-20 14-34 39-43 45-50 46-51 22-26 61-66 2-2 66-71 75-80 85-7 88-10 33-37 29-33 62-67 1-1
