here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	11-11 16-16 25-25 8-8 14-14 15-15 28-28 3-3 2-2 9-9 17-17 12-12 10-10 30-30 20-20 6-6 18-18 21-21 4-4 24-24 29-29 1-1 19-19 22-22 23-23 26-26 0-0 13-13 27-27 7-7 31-31 5-5	11-11 16-16 25-25 8-8 14-14 15-15 28-28 3-3 2-2 9-9 17-17 12-12 10-10 30-30 20-20 6-6 18-18 21-21 4-4 24-24 29-29 1-1 19-19 22-22 23-23 26-26 0-0 13-13 27-27 7-7 31-31 5-5
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	14-18 62-67 68-73 48-53 57-62 59-64 25-29 65-70 34-38 60-65 38-42 12-16 50-55 70-75 39-43 71-76 3-3 2-2 16-20 44-49 67-72 20-24 24-28 51-56 95-80 64-69 27-31 66-71 43-48 33-37 54-59 30-34 40-44 93-78 94-79 17-21 19-23 23-27 58-63 47-52 4-4 53-58 45-50 26-30 9-13 28-32 22-26 29-33 36-40 1-1 46-51 7-11 32-36 55-60 8-12 69-74 0-0 42-47 11-15 35-39 63-68 72-77 61-66 49-54 52-57 37-41 10-14 13-17 56-61 21-25 96-81 31-35 5-5 18-22 15-19 41-45	87-9 62-67 68-73 48-53 57-62 59-64 25-29 65-70 34-38 38-42 12-16 50-55 70-75 86-8 39-43 71-76 3-3 83-32 2-2 16-20 44-49 67-72 20-24 51-56 73-78 64-69 31-19 66-71 43-48 54-59 40-44 49-77 75-80 81-6 17-21 19-23 23-27 58-63 60-65 4-4 53-58 14-34 26-30 9-13 29-33 22-26 45-50 36-40 1-1 46-51 7-11 32-36 55-60 8-12 69-74 0-0 42-47 11-15 35-39 63-68 61-66 74-79 88-10 52-57 37-41 10-14 56-61 85-7 21-25 96-81 5-5 18-22 41-45
