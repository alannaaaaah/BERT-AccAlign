the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	12-16 70-75 15-19 57-62 59-64 51-56 48-53 27-31 55-60 94-79 69-74 22-26 4-4 23-27 68-73 5-5 8-12 35-39 25-29 36-40 61-66 11-15 16-20 1-1 17-21 54-59 71-76 34-38 93-78 32-36 64-69 43-48 29-33 39-43 9-13 44-49 65-70 95-80 63-68 13-17 58-63 47-52 19-23 53-58 66-71 0-0 52-57 37-41 38-42 20-24 28-32 40-44 96-81 18-22 21-25 30-34 7-11 41-45 60-65 46-51 10-14 24-28 42-47 45-50 49-54 33-37 3-3 50-55 56-61 67-72 31-35 62-67 72-77 2-2 26-30 14-18	12-16 70-75 88-10 57-62 59-64 51-56 48-53 73-78 81-6 27-31 55-60 86-8 69-74 49-77 4-4 23-27 68-73 5-5 8-12 25-29 74-79 36-40 87-9 61-66 11-15 16-20 1-1 17-21 54-59 71-76 34-38 32-36 64-69 43-48 29-33 39-43 9-13 44-49 65-70 75-80 63-68 58-63 19-23 53-58 66-71 0-0 52-57 37-41 38-42 20-24 40-44 96-81 18-22 21-25 30-34 7-11 41-45 60-65 46-51 10-14 45-50 42-47 3-3 50-55 56-61 67-72 62-67 2-2 26-30 22-26
