here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	6-6 23-23 28-28 31-31 4-4 8-8 18-18 9-9 22-22 17-17 3-3 12-12 5-5 20-20 29-29 16-16 0-0 21-21 26-26 14-14 11-11 27-27 24-24 1-1 15-15 2-2 19-19 25-25 10-10 7-7 30-30 13-13	6-6 23-23 28-28 31-31 4-4 8-8 18-18 9-9 22-22 17-17 3-3 12-12 5-5 20-20 29-29 16-16 0-0 21-21 26-26 14-14 11-11 27-27 24-24 1-1 15-15 2-2 19-19 25-25 10-10 7-7 30-30 13-13
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	24-28 4-4 59-64 71-76 31-35 3-3 57-62 95-80 18-22 93-78 61-66 41-45 54-59 49-54 65-70 37-41 46-51 58-63 44-49 10-14 96-81 45-50 35-39 62-67 30-34 67-72 23-27 17-21 15-19 36-40 28-32 53-58 11-15 12-16 16-20 2-2 43-48 13-17 6-7 8-12 7-11 26-30 19-23 21-25 64-69 69-74 9-13 20-24 56-61 39-43 29-33 72-77 27-31 34-38 55-60 47-52 1-1 52-57 63-68 94-79 60-65 70-75 42-47 32-36 5-5 33-37 68-73 0-0 38-42 48-53 66-71 51-56 22-26 40-44 50-55 14-18 25-29	4-4 86-8 59-64 71-76 31-35 88-10 3-3 57-62 95-80 18-22 75-80 61-66 41-45 54-59 65-70 37-41 46-51 58-63 44-49 49-77 10-14 96-81 15-35 45-50 73-78 35-39 62-67 30-34 67-72 23-27 74-79 17-21 36-40 53-58 11-15 12-16 16-20 2-2 43-48 6-7 8-12 7-11 31-19 26-30 19-23 21-25 64-69 69-74 83-32 9-13 20-24 56-61 39-43 34-38 55-60 1-1 52-57 63-68 60-65 87-9 70-75 42-47 32-36 5-5 33-37 85-7 81-6 87-17 68-73 0-0 38-42 48-53 66-71 51-56 82-31 22-26 40-44 50-55 25-29 84-33
