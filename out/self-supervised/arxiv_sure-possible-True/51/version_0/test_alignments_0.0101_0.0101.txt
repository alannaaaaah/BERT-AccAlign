in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	25-29 23-27 24-28 14-14 15-15 5-5 6-6 0-0 20-24 12-12 13-13 26-30 29-33 31-35 28-32 18-22 22-26 3-3 7-7 4-4 16-16 1-1 30-34 10-10 19-23 11-11 8-8 17-21 9-9 2-2 21-25 27-31	25-29 23-27 24-28 14-14 15-15 5-5 6-6 0-0 20-24 12-12 13-13 26-30 29-33 31-35 28-32 18-22 22-26 3-3 7-7 4-4 16-16 1-1 30-34 10-10 19-23 11-11 8-8 17-21 9-9 2-2 21-25 27-31
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	31-31 20-20 14-14 15-15 5-5 6-6 0-0 21-21 17-17 19-19 12-12 13-13 25-25 22-22 3-3 27-27 7-7 4-4 16-16 1-1 26-26 23-23 28-28 10-10 29-29 11-11 8-8 9-9 2-2 24-24 18-18 30-30	31-31 20-20 14-14 15-15 5-5 6-6 0-0 21-21 17-17 19-19 12-12 13-13 25-25 22-22 3-3 27-27 7-7 4-4 16-16 1-1 26-26 23-23 28-28 10-10 29-29 11-11 8-8 9-9 2-2 24-24 18-18 30-30
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	13-17 12-16 51-56 40-44 16-20 5-5 20-24 93-78 32-36 28-32 18-22 70-75 46-51 58-63 55-60 94-79 61-66 35-39 23-27 43-48 44-49 62-67 29-33 31-35 3-3 4-4 11-15 50-55 67-72 41-45 19-23 48-53 64-69 68-73 14-18 27-31 15-19 24-28 65-70 9-13 0-0 60-65 63-68 22-26 1-1 8-12 53-58 10-14 39-43 57-62 59-64 7-11 2-2 25-29 69-74 72-77 96-81 34-38 42-47 6-7 38-42 71-76 47-52 54-59 26-30 30-34 66-71 37-41 52-57 95-80 17-21 56-61 49-54 36-40 33-37 21-25 45-50	25-29 69-74 23-27 72-77 12-16 51-56 65-70 81-6 43-48 40-44 74-79 16-20 96-81 83-32 5-5 34-38 42-47 73-78 86-8 88-10 9-13 20-24 0-0 44-49 38-42 60-65 62-67 71-76 54-59 26-30 29-33 31-19 63-68 32-36 18-22 22-26 70-75 3-3 4-4 1-1 11-15 8-12 50-55 53-58 82-31 46-51 66-71 67-72 41-45 58-63 85-7 14-34 19-23 37-41 48-53 49-77 75-80 52-57 64-69 10-14 68-73 17-21 39-43 57-62 56-61 59-64 36-40 7-11 55-60 2-2 33-37 61-66 21-25 45-50 87-9 35-39
