here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	16-16 31-31 19-19 22-22 7-7 0-0 23-23 27-27 4-4 24-24 8-8 3-3 15-15 14-14 9-9 30-30 20-20 11-11 17-17 10-10 21-21 6-6 12-12 13-13 28-28 25-25 18-18 1-1 26-26 5-5 2-2 29-29	16-16 31-31 19-19 22-22 7-7 0-0 23-23 27-27 4-4 24-24 8-8 3-3 15-15 14-14 9-9 30-30 20-20 11-11 17-17 10-10 21-21 6-6 12-12 13-13 28-28 25-25 18-18 1-1 26-26 5-5 2-2 29-29
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	70-75 60-65 12-16 47-52 57-62 62-67 16-20 96-81 36-40 94-79 10-14 46-51 11-15 31-35 69-74 5-5 30-34 45-50 61-66 54-59 71-76 56-61 9-13 42-47 43-48 14-18 34-38 19-23 32-36 0-0 72-77 37-41 93-78 39-43 66-71 27-31 22-26 33-37 67-72 6-7 1-1 15-19 28-32 95-80 38-42 41-45 13-17 23-27 17-21 44-49 49-54 21-25 52-57 25-29 35-39 64-69 2-2 18-22 24-28 4-4 7-11 3-3 29-33 40-44 26-30 63-68 48-53 55-60 58-63 8-12 59-64 50-55 20-24 53-58 65-70 51-56 68-73	70-75 60-65 12-16 57-62 62-67 16-20 96-81 36-40 83-32 10-14 46-51 11-15 69-74 5-5 45-50 61-66 20-24 14-34 54-59 71-76 56-61 86-8 9-13 42-47 43-48 87-9 49-77 75-80 34-38 19-23 73-78 32-36 0-0 72-77 37-41 82-31 39-43 66-71 27-31 22-26 33-37 67-72 6-7 1-1 38-42 41-45 88-10 23-27 17-21 44-49 21-25 52-57 25-29 35-39 74-79 64-69 18-22 81-6 4-4 7-11 3-3 31-19 85-7 29-33 40-44 26-30 30-18 63-68 48-53 55-60 58-63 8-12 59-64 50-55 2-2 53-58 65-70 51-56 68-73
