in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	11-11 10-10 29-33 24-28 23-27 25-29 30-34 8-8 1-1 0-0 5-5 6-6 9-9 17-21 19-23 14-14 12-12 27-31 26-30 28-32 18-22 31-35 13-13 22-26 3-3 15-15 7-7 20-24 2-2 21-25 16-16 4-4	11-11 10-10 29-33 24-28 23-27 25-29 30-34 8-8 1-1 0-0 5-5 6-6 9-9 17-21 19-23 14-14 12-12 27-31 26-30 28-32 18-22 31-35 13-13 22-26 3-3 15-15 7-7 20-24 2-2 21-25 16-16 4-4
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	11-11 10-10 26-26 17-17 22-22 24-24 23-23 8-8 1-1 0-0 5-5 6-6 9-9 14-14 12-12 19-19 25-25 28-28 13-13 3-3 15-15 7-7 29-29 2-2 20-20 16-16 27-27 4-4 31-31 18-18 30-30 21-21	11-11 10-10 26-26 17-17 22-22 24-24 23-23 8-8 1-1 0-0 5-5 6-6 9-9 14-14 12-12 19-19 25-25 28-28 13-13 3-3 15-15 7-7 29-29 2-2 20-20 16-16 27-27 4-4 31-31 18-18 30-30 21-21
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	64-69 35-39 61-66 0-0 7-11 58-63 43-48 33-37 18-22 62-67 46-51 71-76 20-24 52-57 65-70 8-12 9-13 69-74 10-14 24-28 70-75 50-55 5-5 56-61 17-21 36-40 96-81 27-31 38-42 26-30 47-52 31-35 3-3 53-58 72-77 41-45 21-25 4-4 42-47 29-33 15-19 23-27 25-29 30-34 45-50 63-68 55-60 40-44 66-71 37-41 28-32 94-79 22-26 95-80 51-56 6-7 11-15 68-73 59-64 16-20 1-1 60-65 54-59 34-38 19-23 93-78 49-54 13-17 12-16 48-53 57-62 67-72 39-43 44-49 32-36 2-2 14-18	64-69 35-39 61-66 0-0 7-11 83-32 82-31 75-80 58-63 43-48 33-37 18-22 62-67 46-51 71-76 86-8 20-24 88-10 52-57 15-35 65-70 8-12 9-13 69-74 10-14 87-9 70-75 50-55 5-5 56-61 17-21 36-40 96-81 38-42 26-30 47-52 31-35 3-3 53-58 72-77 41-45 21-25 4-4 42-47 29-33 25-29 30-34 81-6 49-77 45-50 63-68 55-60 40-44 66-71 37-41 73-78 22-26 6-7 51-56 11-15 31-19 68-73 59-64 16-20 1-1 60-65 54-59 34-38 19-23 74-79 12-16 85-7 48-53 57-62 67-72 39-43 44-49 32-36 2-2
