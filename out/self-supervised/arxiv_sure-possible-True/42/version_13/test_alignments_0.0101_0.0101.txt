in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	9-9 18-22 3-3 0-0 6-6 24-28 20-24 4-4 11-11 14-14 19-23 5-5 17-21 8-8 2-2 13-13 28-32 25-29 21-25 10-10 1-1 27-31 30-34 22-26 29-33 12-12 7-7 31-35 16-16 23-27 15-15 26-30	9-9 18-22 3-3 0-0 6-6 24-28 20-24 4-4 11-11 14-14 19-23 5-5 17-21 8-8 2-2 13-13 28-32 25-29 21-25 10-10 1-1 27-31 30-34 22-26 29-33 12-12 7-7 31-35 16-16 23-27 15-15 26-30
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	9-9 25-25 30-30 21-21 3-3 27-27 0-0 24-24 6-6 20-20 31-31 17-17 4-4 23-23 26-26 11-11 19-19 14-14 22-22 5-5 8-8 2-2 13-13 18-18 29-29 10-10 1-1 28-28 12-12 7-7 16-16 15-15	9-9 25-25 30-30 21-21 3-3 27-27 0-0 24-24 6-6 20-20 31-31 17-17 4-4 23-23 26-26 11-11 19-19 14-14 22-22 5-5 8-8 2-2 13-13 18-18 29-29 10-10 1-1 28-28 12-12 7-7 16-16 15-15
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	6-7 41-45 70-75 44-49 32-36 52-57 39-43 19-23 2-2 28-32 60-65 40-44 15-19 11-15 27-31 31-35 23-27 68-73 47-52 3-3 0-0 8-12 95-80 45-50 5-5 25-29 12-16 67-72 42-47 96-81 30-34 50-55 56-61 22-26 69-74 61-66 13-17 33-37 26-30 51-56 38-42 7-11 62-67 37-41 35-39 24-28 20-24 58-63 17-21 34-38 48-53 94-79 43-48 93-78 1-1 72-77 66-71 18-22 14-18 36-40 65-70 10-14 46-51 63-68 64-69 4-4 9-13 71-76 16-20 54-59 55-60 57-62 21-25 49-54 29-33 53-58 59-64	73-78 6-7 41-45 70-75 44-49 32-36 52-57 39-43 19-23 88-10 81-6 2-2 60-65 40-44 11-15 31-35 68-73 74-79 47-52 3-3 0-0 49-77 8-12 45-50 5-5 25-29 12-16 15-35 67-72 42-47 96-81 30-34 50-55 56-61 22-26 69-74 61-66 33-37 26-30 51-56 38-42 7-11 62-67 37-41 35-39 20-24 58-63 83-32 17-21 34-38 48-53 31-19 75-80 43-48 1-1 72-77 66-71 18-22 86-8 36-40 65-70 10-14 46-51 63-68 87-9 64-69 4-4 85-7 9-13 71-76 16-20 54-59 55-60 57-62 82-31 21-25 29-33 53-58 59-64
