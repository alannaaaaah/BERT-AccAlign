here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	21-21 22-22 8-8 28-28 27-27 0-0 23-23 15-15 24-24 25-25 3-3 9-9 14-14 19-19 4-4 6-6 30-30 1-1 29-29 11-11 18-18 17-17 7-7 10-10 16-16 20-20 31-31 12-12 26-26 2-2 5-5 13-13	21-21 22-22 8-8 28-28 27-27 0-0 23-23 15-15 24-24 25-25 3-3 9-9 14-14 19-19 4-4 6-6 30-30 1-1 29-29 11-11 18-18 17-17 7-7 10-10 16-16 20-20 31-31 12-12 26-26 2-2 5-5 13-13
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	23-27 57-62 29-33 95-80 0-0 35-39 65-70 67-72 46-51 55-60 50-55 34-38 13-17 15-19 53-58 25-29 10-14 58-63 61-66 36-40 41-45 26-30 11-15 6-7 62-67 9-13 66-71 56-61 32-36 12-16 39-43 40-44 38-42 94-79 64-69 68-73 72-77 18-22 42-47 49-54 43-48 17-21 69-74 28-32 63-68 20-24 93-78 37-41 3-3 4-4 45-50 31-35 60-65 54-59 70-75 14-18 44-49 22-26 16-20 33-37 8-12 71-76 1-1 27-31 96-81 24-28 30-34 21-25 52-57 7-11 19-23 47-52 48-53 59-64 51-56 2-2 5-5	57-62 31-19 29-33 0-0 35-39 65-70 67-72 46-51 55-60 50-55 34-38 86-8 87-9 53-58 25-29 10-14 58-63 61-66 83-32 36-40 41-45 26-30 73-78 81-6 6-7 11-15 62-67 9-13 66-71 56-61 32-36 12-16 39-43 40-44 38-42 64-69 88-10 68-73 72-77 18-22 42-47 43-48 17-21 69-74 63-68 20-24 37-41 3-3 15-35 4-4 45-50 31-35 82-31 60-65 54-59 70-75 44-49 74-79 75-80 22-26 49-77 16-20 33-37 8-12 71-76 1-1 96-81 30-34 85-7 21-25 52-57 7-11 19-23 47-52 48-53 59-64 51-56 2-2 5-5
