in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	17-21 24-28 27-31 22-26 4-4 12-12 29-33 9-9 11-11 19-23 0-0 1-1 23-27 25-29 6-6 10-10 2-2 7-7 20-24 15-15 18-22 28-32 21-25 8-8 31-35 26-30 3-3 13-13 30-34 14-14 5-5 16-16	17-21 24-28 27-31 22-26 4-4 12-12 29-33 9-9 11-11 19-23 0-0 1-1 23-27 25-29 6-6 10-10 2-2 7-7 20-24 15-15 18-22 28-32 21-25 8-8 31-35 26-30 3-3 13-13 30-34 14-14 5-5 16-16
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	18-18 27-27 24-24 4-4 12-12 9-9 11-11 31-31 23-23 0-0 17-17 1-1 28-28 25-25 30-30 21-21 6-6 10-10 2-2 7-7 15-15 22-22 8-8 19-19 3-3 13-13 29-29 14-14 5-5 20-20 16-16 26-26	18-18 27-27 24-24 4-4 12-12 9-9 11-11 31-31 23-23 0-0 17-17 1-1 28-28 25-25 30-30 21-21 6-6 10-10 2-2 7-7 15-15 22-22 8-8 19-19 3-3 13-13 29-29 14-14 5-5 20-20 16-16 26-26
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	48-53 7-11 14-18 34-38 57-62 61-66 15-19 62-67 0-0 93-78 16-20 23-27 50-55 54-59 28-32 18-22 21-25 41-45 52-57 31-35 45-50 95-80 26-30 32-36 33-37 6-7 55-60 8-12 60-65 39-43 24-28 68-73 94-79 65-70 56-61 4-4 66-71 19-23 12-16 1-1 25-29 38-42 37-41 67-72 51-56 3-3 13-17 43-48 17-21 44-49 64-69 59-64 22-26 58-63 70-75 49-54 40-44 47-52 2-2 20-24 30-34 42-47 5-5 46-51 27-31 53-58 69-74 29-33 71-76 35-39 11-15 36-40 96-81 9-13 72-77 10-14 63-68	86-8 48-53 7-11 34-38 57-62 61-66 62-67 0-0 16-20 50-55 54-59 18-22 74-79 21-25 41-45 52-57 31-35 45-50 26-30 32-36 33-37 6-7 55-60 8-12 83-32 60-65 88-10 39-43 68-73 65-70 56-61 4-4 31-19 66-71 19-23 12-16 82-31 1-1 25-29 38-42 87-9 37-41 67-72 51-56 3-3 81-6 49-77 43-48 85-7 17-21 44-49 64-69 59-64 22-26 58-63 70-75 40-44 47-52 2-2 20-24 30-34 42-47 5-5 75-80 46-51 53-58 69-74 29-33 71-76 35-39 11-15 36-40 15-35 96-81 9-13 72-77 73-78 10-14 63-68
