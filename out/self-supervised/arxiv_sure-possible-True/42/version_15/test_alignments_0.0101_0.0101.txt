the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	49-54 70-75 68-73 42-47 51-56 59-64 14-18 34-38 67-72 24-28 10-14 52-57 96-81 29-33 72-77 39-43 66-71 58-63 27-31 17-21 71-76 62-67 11-15 26-30 35-39 0-0 45-50 54-59 25-29 6-7 28-32 93-78 53-58 47-52 12-16 41-45 65-70 48-53 60-65 56-61 36-40 61-66 95-80 3-3 22-26 64-69 31-35 50-55 55-60 44-49 9-13 57-62 21-25 33-37 7-11 32-36 30-34 13-17 37-41 18-22 16-20 1-1 20-24 4-4 5-5 23-27 69-74 2-2 15-19 63-68 38-42 40-44 8-12 19-23 46-51 94-79 43-48	70-75 68-73 42-47 51-56 59-64 34-38 67-72 10-14 52-57 96-81 29-33 72-77 39-43 66-71 58-63 17-21 71-76 62-67 11-15 26-30 35-39 0-0 85-7 45-50 54-59 25-29 6-7 53-58 82-31 74-79 47-52 12-16 41-45 65-70 48-53 60-65 56-61 31-19 36-40 61-66 3-3 22-26 64-69 31-35 50-55 55-60 44-49 9-13 57-62 15-35 21-25 33-37 7-11 32-36 49-77 30-34 73-78 81-6 37-41 88-10 18-22 16-20 20-24 1-1 4-4 83-32 5-5 86-8 69-74 2-2 63-68 38-42 40-44 87-9 8-12 19-23 46-51 43-48 75-80
