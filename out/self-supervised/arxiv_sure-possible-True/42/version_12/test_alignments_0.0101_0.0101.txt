the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	23-27 48-53 34-38 7-11 56-61 32-36 94-79 12-16 47-52 15-19 66-71 0-0 71-76 26-30 57-62 29-33 17-21 1-1 54-59 65-70 38-42 19-23 36-40 21-25 2-2 35-39 60-65 58-63 28-32 20-24 33-37 24-28 45-50 61-66 27-31 6-7 31-35 11-15 8-12 72-77 3-3 46-51 63-68 42-47 13-17 9-13 37-41 49-54 51-56 68-73 69-74 50-55 25-29 96-81 52-57 22-26 93-78 41-45 59-64 70-75 16-20 62-67 95-80 10-14 44-49 55-60 30-34 53-58 4-4 5-5 18-22 40-44 39-43 67-72 14-18 43-48 64-69	88-10 48-53 34-38 7-11 56-61 75-80 32-36 12-16 47-52 66-71 0-0 71-76 26-30 57-62 29-33 17-21 73-78 1-1 54-59 65-70 38-42 83-32 19-23 36-40 85-7 21-25 2-2 35-39 60-65 58-63 15-35 20-24 33-37 45-50 61-66 6-7 31-35 11-15 8-12 72-77 3-3 46-51 63-68 42-47 9-13 37-41 49-77 51-56 68-73 69-74 50-55 25-29 96-81 52-57 22-26 86-8 87-9 41-45 59-64 70-75 16-20 62-67 10-14 44-49 82-31 55-60 81-6 74-79 30-34 53-58 4-4 5-5 18-22 40-44 31-19 39-43 67-72 43-48 64-69
