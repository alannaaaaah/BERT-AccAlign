in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	11-11 17-21 4-4 0-0 12-12 28-32 27-31 30-34 20-24 7-7 19-23 25-29 18-22 31-35 13-13 16-16 22-26 23-27 8-8 14-14 21-25 24-28 3-3 9-9 10-10 1-1 26-30 5-5 6-6 29-33 2-2 15-15	11-11 17-21 4-4 0-0 12-12 28-32 27-31 30-34 20-24 7-7 19-23 25-29 18-22 31-35 13-13 16-16 22-26 23-27 8-8 14-14 21-25 24-28 3-3 9-9 10-10 1-1 26-30 5-5 6-6 29-33 2-2 15-15
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	20-20 11-11 23-23 30-30 4-4 0-0 12-12 29-29 27-27 26-26 25-25 28-28 7-7 13-13 18-18 16-16 8-8 17-17 14-14 24-24 3-3 9-9 21-21 10-10 19-19 1-1 5-5 6-6 2-2 22-22 15-15 31-31	20-20 11-11 23-23 30-30 4-4 0-0 12-12 29-29 27-27 26-26 25-25 28-28 7-7 13-13 18-18 16-16 8-8 17-17 14-14 24-24 3-3 9-9 21-21 10-10 19-19 1-1 5-5 6-6 2-2 22-22 15-15 31-31
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	56-61 65-70 95-80 9-13 20-24 68-73 67-72 69-74 21-25 24-28 61-66 26-30 32-36 34-38 13-17 93-78 49-54 4-4 0-0 94-79 12-16 55-60 27-31 35-39 47-52 31-35 40-44 22-26 54-59 38-42 71-76 59-64 42-47 51-56 66-71 8-12 53-58 45-50 70-75 41-45 60-65 96-81 28-32 16-20 30-34 25-29 62-67 15-19 63-68 36-40 39-43 3-3 1-1 6-7 5-5 29-33 48-53 2-2 46-51 52-57 17-21 37-41 50-55 44-49 19-23 18-22 58-63 57-62 10-14 23-27 72-77 33-37 7-11 43-48 64-69 11-15 14-18	49-77 56-61 65-70 9-13 74-79 20-24 68-73 67-72 69-74 21-25 61-66 26-30 32-36 34-38 88-10 83-32 4-4 0-0 12-16 55-60 35-39 47-52 31-35 40-44 87-9 22-26 54-59 38-42 71-76 59-64 42-47 51-56 66-71 8-12 53-58 75-80 45-50 70-75 41-45 60-65 96-81 81-6 16-20 30-34 25-29 62-67 73-78 63-68 36-40 39-43 3-3 1-1 6-7 5-5 86-8 29-33 48-53 2-2 46-51 52-57 17-21 37-41 82-31 31-19 50-55 44-49 19-23 18-22 58-63 57-62 10-14 72-77 33-37 7-11 43-48 15-35 64-69 11-15 85-7
