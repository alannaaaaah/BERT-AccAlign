in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	19-23 29-33 16-16 9-9 12-12 7-7 20-24 30-34 25-29 2-2 31-35 28-32 21-25 8-8 1-1 17-21 0-0 22-26 4-4 14-14 24-28 3-3 11-11 5-5 23-27 26-30 18-22 15-15 10-10 6-6 13-13 27-31	19-23 29-33 16-16 9-9 12-12 7-7 20-24 30-34 25-29 2-2 31-35 28-32 21-25 8-8 1-1 17-21 0-0 22-26 4-4 14-14 24-28 3-3 11-11 5-5 23-27 26-30 18-22 15-15 10-10 6-6 13-13 27-31
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	24-24 19-19 29-29 16-16 9-9 25-25 12-12 7-7 30-30 2-2 31-31 8-8 1-1 20-20 0-0 26-26 23-23 4-4 14-14 3-3 22-22 11-11 5-5 27-27 18-18 17-17 21-21 15-15 10-10 6-6 13-13 28-28	24-24 19-19 29-29 16-16 9-9 25-25 12-12 7-7 30-30 2-2 31-31 8-8 1-1 20-20 0-0 26-26 23-23 4-4 14-14 3-3 22-22 11-11 5-5 27-27 18-18 17-17 21-21 15-15 10-10 6-6 13-13 28-28
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	39-43 62-67 69-74 59-64 13-17 72-77 37-41 60-65 31-35 42-47 15-19 68-73 22-26 4-4 38-42 70-75 64-69 54-59 6-7 36-40 14-18 67-72 18-22 27-31 35-39 96-81 40-44 25-29 45-50 48-53 28-32 17-21 0-0 41-45 51-56 71-76 49-54 56-61 50-55 52-57 29-33 66-71 57-62 30-34 2-2 55-60 93-78 8-12 7-11 9-13 24-28 94-79 33-37 26-30 10-14 61-66 63-68 16-20 95-80 19-23 32-36 43-48 20-24 11-15 58-63 47-52 53-58 46-51 21-25 65-70 1-1 3-3 44-49 12-16 5-5 23-27 34-38	39-43 62-67 69-74 59-64 72-77 37-41 60-65 31-35 42-47 68-73 22-26 4-4 38-42 70-75 64-69 74-79 54-59 6-7 36-40 67-72 18-22 31-19 85-7 35-39 96-81 83-32 40-44 25-29 45-50 49-77 48-53 17-21 0-0 41-45 81-6 51-56 71-76 15-35 87-9 56-61 86-8 50-55 52-57 29-33 66-71 57-62 30-34 2-2 55-60 8-12 88-10 7-11 9-13 33-37 26-30 10-14 82-31 61-66 63-68 16-20 19-23 32-36 43-48 20-24 11-15 58-63 47-52 53-58 46-51 21-25 65-70 1-1 3-3 44-49 12-16 5-5 73-78 75-80 34-38
