here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	1-1 8-8 15-15 2-2 18-18 23-23 30-30 17-17 29-29 10-10 4-4 24-24 26-26 25-25 6-6 12-12 9-9 11-11 3-3 22-22 21-21 27-27 5-5 19-19 16-16 28-28 7-7 31-31 20-20 0-0 13-13 14-14	1-1 8-8 15-15 2-2 18-18 23-23 30-30 17-17 29-29 10-10 4-4 24-24 26-26 25-25 6-6 12-12 9-9 11-11 3-3 22-22 21-21 27-27 5-5 19-19 16-16 28-28 7-7 31-31 20-20 0-0 13-13 14-14
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	27-31 6-7 1-1 2-2 25-29 31-35 15-19 21-25 23-27 43-48 57-62 55-60 18-22 49-54 71-76 29-33 14-18 5-5 51-56 70-75 17-21 22-26 9-13 20-24 36-40 69-74 0-0 68-73 93-78 28-32 19-23 46-51 53-58 60-65 16-20 44-49 62-67 37-41 33-37 64-69 67-72 4-4 48-53 50-55 7-11 26-30 65-70 61-66 11-15 24-28 42-47 45-50 95-80 56-61 40-44 59-64 38-42 47-52 8-12 39-43 10-14 58-63 63-68 32-36 3-3 72-77 66-71 35-39 96-81 13-17 12-16 41-45 94-79 34-38 52-57 54-59 30-34	6-7 1-1 31-19 2-2 25-29 31-35 21-25 43-48 57-62 55-60 18-22 71-76 29-33 5-5 51-56 70-75 17-21 22-26 9-13 20-24 85-7 36-40 69-74 0-0 68-73 19-23 46-51 87-9 53-58 60-65 86-8 16-20 44-49 73-78 62-67 37-41 33-37 64-69 67-72 4-4 48-53 49-77 50-55 7-11 26-30 65-70 61-66 11-15 83-32 42-47 75-80 45-50 56-61 40-44 59-64 38-42 15-35 81-6 47-52 8-12 39-43 82-31 10-14 58-63 63-68 32-36 3-3 72-77 74-79 66-71 35-39 88-10 96-81 12-16 41-45 34-38 52-57 54-59 30-34
