the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	9-13 43-48 52-57 39-43 0-0 12-16 60-65 72-77 26-30 17-21 38-42 22-26 61-66 11-15 29-33 24-28 56-61 28-32 20-24 93-78 44-49 18-22 33-37 71-76 69-74 7-11 50-55 62-67 57-62 55-60 53-58 8-12 2-2 54-59 3-3 5-5 4-4 21-25 34-38 10-14 27-31 48-53 46-51 96-81 30-34 94-79 25-29 64-69 49-54 47-52 42-47 63-68 70-75 67-72 23-27 37-41 14-18 68-73 15-19 19-23 59-64 16-20 13-17 45-50 32-36 36-40 41-45 6-7 40-44 65-70 1-1 31-35 35-39 58-63 66-71 95-80 51-56	9-13 43-48 52-57 39-43 0-0 12-16 60-65 72-77 74-79 26-30 17-21 38-42 22-26 61-66 11-15 29-33 56-61 75-80 20-24 44-49 18-22 33-37 71-76 69-74 7-11 50-55 62-67 57-62 55-60 53-58 8-12 2-2 83-32 31-19 54-59 3-3 5-5 4-4 21-25 34-38 10-14 48-53 46-51 81-6 96-81 30-34 86-8 25-29 64-69 47-52 42-47 63-68 70-75 67-72 87-9 37-41 82-31 68-73 88-10 19-23 15-35 59-64 16-20 45-50 32-36 36-40 41-45 6-7 40-44 65-70 85-7 1-1 31-35 35-39 49-77 58-63 73-78 66-71 51-56
