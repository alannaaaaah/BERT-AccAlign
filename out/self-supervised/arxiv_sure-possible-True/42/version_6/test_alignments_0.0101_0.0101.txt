in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	5-5 26-30 7-7 12-12 19-23 15-15 25-29 9-9 20-24 3-3 28-32 16-16 1-1 21-25 8-8 4-4 11-11 31-35 17-21 2-2 18-22 30-34 14-14 29-33 23-27 6-6 27-31 0-0 10-10 13-13 22-26 24-28	5-5 26-30 7-7 12-12 19-23 15-15 25-29 9-9 20-24 3-3 28-32 16-16 1-1 21-25 8-8 4-4 11-11 31-35 17-21 2-2 18-22 30-34 14-14 29-33 23-27 6-6 27-31 0-0 10-10 13-13 22-26 24-28
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	5-5 17-17 21-21 27-27 7-7 12-12 26-26 15-15 9-9 31-31 24-24 3-3 22-22 29-29 16-16 18-18 1-1 8-8 4-4 25-25 11-11 28-28 2-2 19-19 23-23 14-14 20-20 6-6 0-0 30-30 10-10 13-13	5-5 17-17 21-21 27-27 7-7 12-12 26-26 15-15 9-9 31-31 24-24 3-3 22-22 29-29 16-16 18-18 1-1 8-8 4-4 25-25 11-11 28-28 2-2 19-19 23-23 14-14 20-20 6-6 0-0 30-30 10-10 13-13
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	26-30 15-19 52-57 10-14 25-29 64-69 20-24 41-45 51-56 3-3 28-32 56-61 17-21 43-48 60-65 93-78 42-47 27-31 65-70 33-37 55-60 72-77 40-44 47-52 62-67 53-58 36-40 37-41 8-12 21-25 6-7 11-15 70-75 32-36 24-28 5-5 54-59 46-51 57-62 94-79 19-23 38-42 69-74 61-66 71-76 13-17 2-2 18-22 49-54 23-27 9-13 0-0 63-68 45-50 12-16 34-38 14-18 96-81 95-80 39-43 68-73 1-1 48-53 59-64 4-4 58-63 7-11 31-35 50-55 30-34 44-49 22-26 67-72 66-71 16-20 29-33 35-39	26-30 52-57 10-14 25-29 64-69 20-24 41-45 51-56 3-3 56-61 81-6 17-21 43-48 60-65 42-47 83-32 65-70 33-37 55-60 72-77 40-44 47-52 62-67 53-58 36-40 37-41 8-12 21-25 6-7 11-15 70-75 31-19 32-36 5-5 54-59 46-51 57-62 19-23 74-79 49-77 75-80 38-42 82-31 69-74 15-35 86-8 61-66 71-76 88-10 2-2 18-22 9-13 0-0 63-68 45-50 85-7 12-16 34-38 96-81 73-78 39-43 68-73 1-1 48-53 59-64 4-4 58-63 7-11 31-35 50-55 30-34 44-49 22-26 67-72 87-9 66-71 16-20 29-33 35-39
