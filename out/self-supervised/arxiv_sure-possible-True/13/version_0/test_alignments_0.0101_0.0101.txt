in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	1-1 29-33 6-6 31-35 8-8 23-27 16-16 12-12 22-26 7-7 18-22 11-11 14-14 28-32 19-23 27-31 24-28 2-2 0-0 30-34 4-4 17-21 21-25 3-3 26-30 10-10 13-13 5-5 9-9 15-15 20-24 25-29	1-1 29-33 6-6 31-35 8-8 23-27 16-16 12-12 22-26 28-19 7-7 18-22 11-11 14-14 28-32 19-23 27-31 24-28 2-2 0-0 30-34 4-4 17-21 21-25 3-3 26-30 10-10 13-13 5-5 9-9 15-15 20-24 25-29
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	1-1 6-6 17-17 8-8 28-28 25-25 16-16 21-21 31-31 12-12 7-7 11-11 14-14 23-23 20-20 30-30 2-2 0-0 29-29 26-26 22-22 4-4 24-24 27-27 3-3 18-18 10-10 13-13 5-5 9-9 15-15 19-19	1-1 6-6 17-17 8-8 28-28 25-25 16-16 21-21 31-31 12-12 7-7 11-11 14-14 23-23 20-20 30-30 2-2 0-0 29-29 26-26 22-22 4-4 24-24 27-27 3-3 18-18 10-10 13-13 5-5 9-9 15-15 19-19
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	33-37 15-19 51-56 12-16 9-13 22-26 11-15 50-55 18-22 37-41 49-54 63-68 2-2 70-75 4-4 69-74 36-40 61-66 40-44 68-73 23-27 53-58 48-53 42-47 28-32 72-77 27-31 47-52 45-50 41-45 64-69 66-71 95-80 20-24 29-33 94-79 44-49 56-61 59-64 54-59 19-23 10-14 65-70 93-78 13-17 30-34 46-51 17-21 21-25 67-72 6-7 16-20 26-30 25-29 1-1 31-35 58-63 39-43 38-42 43-48 32-36 55-60 62-67 7-11 24-28 0-0 60-65 35-39 3-3 52-57 96-81 14-18 34-38 71-76 5-5 8-12 57-62	33-37 51-56 12-16 9-13 22-26 11-15 50-55 18-22 37-41 83-32 87-9 49-54 63-68 2-2 70-75 4-4 31-19 69-74 24-68 36-40 88-10 61-66 40-44 68-73 23-27 53-58 48-53 42-47 81-6 49-77 45-50 73-78 41-45 64-69 66-71 95-80 20-24 82-31 29-33 86-8 44-49 56-61 59-64 74-79 54-59 19-23 10-14 65-70 30-34 46-51 17-21 21-25 67-72 16-20 26-30 25-29 1-1 31-35 58-63 39-43 38-42 43-48 32-36 55-60 62-67 7-11 0-0 60-65 35-39 3-3 52-57 96-81 14-18 34-38 71-76 5-5 8-12 57-62 85-7
