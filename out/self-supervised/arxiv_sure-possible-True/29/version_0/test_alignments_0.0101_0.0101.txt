in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	in contrast , when antennas are arranged in a square array , relatively small space is required for 2d antenna array ( e.g. , 1.0 [math] 0.5m with dual-polarized 8 [math] 8 antenna array ) .	8-8 12-12 2-2 7-7 18-22 17-21 9-9 13-13 23-27 30-34 0-0 6-6 4-4 29-33 15-15 10-10 11-11 21-25 24-28 19-23 22-26 25-29 16-16 31-35 3-3 26-30 28-32 20-24 5-5 1-1 14-14 27-31	8-8 28-19 12-12 2-2 7-7 18-22 17-21 9-9 13-13 23-27 30-34 0-0 6-6 4-4 29-33 15-15 10-10 11-11 21-25 24-28 19-23 22-26 25-29 16-16 31-35 3-3 26-30 28-32 20-24 5-5 1-1 14-14 27-31
here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by defining a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	here we adopt an opposite perspective : we start by considering a riemannian manifold [math] and then use the relationship to identify the divergence functions that arise naturally in that space .	8-8 12-12 2-2 7-7 30-30 9-9 27-27 13-13 0-0 6-6 4-4 21-21 19-19 26-26 15-15 10-10 11-11 24-24 31-31 16-16 23-23 3-3 20-20 25-25 18-18 29-29 22-22 17-17 28-28 5-5 1-1 14-14	8-8 12-12 2-2 7-7 30-30 9-9 27-27 13-13 0-0 6-6 4-4 21-21 19-19 26-26 15-15 10-10 11-11 24-24 31-31 16-16 23-23 3-3 20-20 25-25 18-18 29-29 22-22 17-17 28-28 5-5 1-1 14-14
the simplest way to randomly generate automata is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronizes with high probability ( i.e . the probability they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability ; this overall implies that an uniformly sampled random automata of [math] letters has low reset threshold with high probability .	the simplest way to randomly generate an automaton of [math] letters is to uniformly and independently sample [math] binary row-stochastic matrices : unfortunately , berlinkov first proved in [citation] that two uniformly sampled random binary row-stochastic matrices synchronize with high probability ( i.e . the probability that they form a synchronizing automaton tends to [math] as the matrix dimension tends to infinity ) , then nicaud showed in [citation] that they also have reset threshold of order [math] with high probability .	60-65 41-45 2-2 71-76 70-75 51-56 67-72 52-57 56-61 59-64 69-74 24-28 95-80 8-12 22-26 28-32 72-77 1-1 46-51 49-54 9-13 35-39 50-55 42-47 18-22 23-27 7-11 0-0 29-33 54-59 68-73 39-43 15-19 21-25 62-67 25-29 31-35 48-53 5-5 47-52 94-79 6-7 57-62 66-71 65-70 55-60 30-34 43-48 37-41 53-58 13-17 16-20 61-66 38-42 3-3 26-30 64-69 27-31 14-18 45-50 58-63 96-81 17-21 33-37 34-38 12-16 10-14 4-4 11-15 36-40 40-44 63-68 19-23 32-36 20-24 44-49 93-78	60-65 41-45 2-2 71-76 70-75 51-56 67-72 52-57 56-61 59-64 69-74 87-9 8-12 22-26 28-32 72-77 31-19 1-1 73-78 46-51 50-55 9-13 35-39 42-47 18-22 23-27 7-11 0-0 29-33 54-59 68-73 39-43 21-25 62-67 25-29 31-35 48-53 5-5 47-52 6-7 57-62 66-71 65-70 55-60 49-77 30-34 88-10 43-48 37-41 53-58 16-20 61-66 38-42 3-3 26-30 64-69 75-80 27-31 45-50 58-63 81-6 96-81 17-21 33-37 34-38 85-7 12-16 86-8 10-14 4-4 11-15 36-40 40-44 74-79 63-68 19-23 32-36 20-24 44-49 83-32
